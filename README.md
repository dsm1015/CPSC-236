# Welcome to the CSPC-236 Python Materials Repository!

This repo contains Python files, documents, and notes to assist you in the class.

Feel free to spend as much or as little time here as need be. If you need to catch up with anything, this is a good place to start. I will try my best to update with notes and hands-on assignments. Solutions to the hands-on will become available after the due dates.

Good luck! :snake:
